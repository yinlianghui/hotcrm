# HotCRM

> **The reference app for AI-written enterprise software.** A complete CRM —
> 16 objects, 20 flows, 4 dashboards, 2 AI copilots, 4 languages — is roughly
> **170k tokens** of typed [ObjectStack](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectstack)
> metadata (~19,000 lines): the entire enterprise CRM fits in a single agent
> context window, so an AI can hold it whole, reason about it, and refactor it.
> **Install it online in one click, or fork it and build & ask with Claude
> Code** — it's the reference implementation every marketplace app forks from.

HotCRM is a complete, opinionated CRM built as the **first official application** on the [ObjectStack](https://cloud.objectos.app) marketplace. Install it into any ObjectStack environment in one click and get a working CRM in 30 seconds — or fork it as the canonical example of how to build your own marketplace app.

> **Try it in your browser (no install):** click the StackBlitz badge above. It boots HotCRM in a WebContainer using `@objectstack/driver-sqlite-wasm` (sql.js) instead of `better-sqlite3`, which can't compile inside the WebContainer sandbox. `.stackblitzrc` sets `OS_DATABASE_DRIVER=sqlite-wasm` so the runtime picks the WASM driver automatically. The sandbox boots with `npm install --omit=dev --omit=optional` — WebContainers forbid `npm i -g`, and their bundled pnpm 8 can't read this repo's lockfile — so first load takes ~2 min while npm installs. It also sets `OS_OIDC_PROVIDER_ENABLED=false`: the OIDC provider signs tokens with Ed25519, which the WebContainer's WebCrypto can't generate, and the failure surfaced as a 500 on login. Sign in with `admin@objectos.ai` / `admin123`. Local development still uses pnpm 10 with every feature on.

## 🚀 Install from the marketplace (recommended)

1. Sign in at [cloud.objectos.app](https://cloud.objectos.app).
2. Open **Marketplace → HotCRM** and click **Install** into your environment.
3. Open your environment URL — HotCRM is wired into the Studio shell. Done.

> First-time on ObjectStack? Create an environment from the **Starter** template first, then install HotCRM on top.

---

## 🛠 Run locally (development / fork it)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/objectstack-ai/hotcrm.git
cd hotcrm
pnpm install
pnpm dev                    # ObjectStack runtime starts at http://localhost:4001
```

```bash
pnpm typecheck              # strict TypeScript
pnpm build                  # produces dist/objectstack.json (the publishable artifact)
```

The compiled `dist/objectstack.json` **is** the package — that's what gets uploaded to the marketplace.

---

## 📦 Publish a fork to the marketplace

After you've forked, customized, and renamed the package:

```bash
# 1. Authenticate once (writes ~/.objectstack/cloud.json)
objectstack cloud login

# 2. Build the artifact
pnpm build

# 3. Publish a new version
objectstack package publish dist/objectstack.json \
  --manifest-id app.acme.crm \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --display-name "Acme CRM" \
  --category crm \
  --visibility marketplace \
  --note "Initial release"
```

The CLI is idempotent: re-running with the same `--manifest-id` updates the package; new `--version` values create immutable versioned snapshots.

See [docs: Publishing your first marketplace app](content/docs/marketplace/publishing-your-first-app.mdx) for the full walkthrough.

Every file follows the **`<entity>.<kind>.ts`** convention. The `crm_` prefix on object names is explicit in source — no runtime magic. Both rules are required for marketplace acceptance.

## 🤝 Why fork HotCRM?

Because it's the reference for every ObjectStack convention you'll encounter:

- ✅ `crm_` namespace prefix on every object (explicit, grep-able, marketplace-safe)
- ✅ Strict `*.object.ts` / `*.hook.ts` / `*.action.ts` separation of concerns
- ✅ All metadata validated against `@objectstack/spec` schemas
- ✅ ObjectQL only — no raw SQL anywhere
- ✅ AI-Native — every entity has an `*.action.ts` that's also an AI tool
- ✅ Four-language i18n out of the box
- ✅ Production-shaped sharing rules, profiles, and role hierarchy

If you want to ship an HR app, a project tracker, a help-desk — start by reading HotCRM's structure, then change names.
