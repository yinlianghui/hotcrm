  // ─── Platform capabilities this app needs ─────────────────────────
  // The runtime resolves each capability name to a built-in service plugin
  // and auto-loads it (with extras like Automation's node packs). No need
  // to hand-instantiate plugins or pass `--preset` flags. See
  // packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts CAPABILITY_PROVIDERS for the
  // complete map; explicit `plugins: [...]` always shadows the resolver.
  // `auth` enables the auth/login surface (login/register) via @objectstack/plugin-auth.
  // `ui`   serves the unified Console shell and CRM apps under /_console/
  //        (login at /_console/login). ObjectStack 7.x replaced the legacy
  //        /_studio/ and /_account/ mounts with this single /_console/ surface.
  // Both are required for a clickable login flow when running `objectstack start`
  // off the compiled artifact.
  // Note: the foundational slate (queue, job, cache, settings, email,
  // storage) is auto-injected by the CLI for every non-`minimal`
  // preset — see `ALWAYS_CAPS` in packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts.
  // Listed below only the *opt-in* capabilities this stack actually
  // wants on top of that slate.
  // `triggers` installs the record-change + schedule trigger providers that
  // actually fire autolaunched flows (record_change & schedule types). Without
  // it the `automation` engine registers flows but nothing ever launches them.
  // Schedule triggers run via the job service (in the always-on slate).
  //
  // `ai` is deliberately NOT listed. ObjectStack 11.3.0 (ADR-0025 S2) removed
  // `@objectstack/service-ai` from the open edition — the AI runtime now ships
  // only in the closed cloud package, and the framework CLI does not depend on
  // it. Under ObjectStack 16, `requires: ['ai']` is a *fail-fast* capability:
  // the serve command hard-aborts boot when the package is absent, so keeping it
  // here would break `objectstack start`/`dev` for this open-edition app (the AI
  // block runs before every other capability resolves). The AI metadata is
  // unaffected — the two agents + skills still validate, build into the artifact,
  // and run wherever a runtime provides the `ai` tier (cloud's objectos-runtime).
  // A local open-edition boot simply omits the AI service and hides its console
  // surface. To run AI locally, declare `@objectstack/service-ai` (cloud) in
  // package.json — its mere presence best-effort auto-loads it.
