/**
 * Demo-org bootstrap — bind the seeded demo data to the first real user.
 *
 * A seed cannot name a user. Lookup values resolve against the target's
 * externalId and that only works for objects in the app's own graph, so
 * `owner: 'Dev Admin'` stores the literal string rather than an id, and
 * `cel\`os.user.id\`` inside a seed evaluates to nothing (both verified
 * against 16.1.0). A hook on `sys_user` is rejected at build time —
 * cross-reference validation refuses hooks on objects the app doesn't
 * declare. The user id only exists after first boot, so this has to be a
 * scheduled sweep.
 *
 * Without it a freshly seeded org comes up with every record ownerless, and
 * that quietly disables a tier of the product: "My Leads" / "My Deals" /
 * "My Cases" are empty for everyone, and any `notify` addressed to a record's
 * owner reaches nobody.
 *
 * Idempotent: once a record has an owner the query no longer returns it and
 * each pass is a no-op. `runAs: 'system'` because a scheduled run has no
 * trigger user and these writes must bypass RLS (ADR-0049).
 *
 * Per-record updates inside a loop, not one filtered mass update: the
 * `update_record` node calls `data.update(...)` without `options.multi`, so a
 * filter matching more than one row fails with "Update requires an ID or
 * options.multi=true". Same shape as `case_sla_monitor`.
 *
 * Scoped to a demo install by intent — it claims records for whoever the first
 * user is. A real deployment assigns ownership through import or territory
 * rules instead, and by then nothing is ownerless for this to pick up.
 *
 * ─── This flow must NOT staff anybody (#640) ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The demo org now also has PEOPLE — an NA rep, an EU rep and a sales manager
 * holding the positions the sharing rules and `opportunity_approval` route to
 * (`src/sharing/demo-staffing.ts`). That staffing deliberately does not happen
 * here, and the obvious "just add a create_record on sys_user" is refused twice
 * over:
 *
 *   - This flow ships in the ARTIFACT, so it runs in a customer's org too. The
 *     one outcome #640 rules out unconditionally is synthetic users appearing
 *     there, and the only way to make that impossible rather than unlikely is
 *     for the artifact to contain no mechanism that can create one.
 *     `test/demo-staffing.test.ts` fails on any flow node that writes an
 *     identity table.
 *   - It would not produce usable people anyway: identity tables are
 *     `managedBy: 'better-auth'` (ADR-0092), and a row inserted around that
 *     surface has no credential — an account nobody can sign in as.
 *
 * Staffing therefore lives in `pnpm demo:staff`, which drives a LOCAL dev
 * server through the platform's own admin endpoints. It also depends on this
 * flow's behaviour staying exactly as it is: the demo's whole point is that a
 * rep reads accounts they do NOT own (a `private` OWD already admits the owner,
 * so a share to the owner proves nothing). The reps are created after the dev
 * admin and appended to `sys_user`, so `get_user`'s unordered "first user" is
 * unchanged by staffing — and the staffing script re-checks that from the other
 * side, failing if any demo user turns out to own a seeded account. Ownership
 * itself is #548's subject; do not redefine it here.
 *
 * ─── TWO ownership columns, not one (#622) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every claimed object carries two:
 *
 *   - `owner`    — the app's own `lookup(sys_user)` field. Drives the "My …"
 *                  views, the owner-addressed `notify` in every sweep, and the
 *                  owner axis of the analytics datasets.
 *   - `owner_id` — the PLATFORM ownership column ObjectQL injects into every
 *                  user-owned object. This is the one — and the only one — the
 *                  sharing service reads: under `sharingModel: 'private'` the
 *                  OWD baseline admits the owner of `owner_id` and a share can
 *                  only WIDEN from there.
 *
 * They are independent columns, so claiming one does not claim the other, and
 * an app field that happens to be named `owner` is not the platform's owner.
 * This flow used to stamp `owner` alone. A row that reached the platform
 * ownerless therefore came out of the sweep looking claimed (`owner` = the dev
 * admin) while still being owned by nobody as far as access control is
 * concerned — `PATCH` answered 403 for EVERY user including the admin, and the
 * attachment surface, which gates on `canEdit(parent)`, answered 403
 * `ATTACHMENT_PARENT_ACCESS` on upload. Worse, the sweep's own filter then read
 * `owner != null` and never looked at the row again: the state was terminal.
 *
 * Why rows reach the platform ownerless at all: seed writes run under
 * `{ isSystem: true }`, which by the seeder's documented contract DISABLES the
 * security plugin's auto-injection of `organization_id` / `owner_id` — "seeds
 * either declare those fields explicitly per record". HotCRM's seeds cannot
 * declare it: `cel\`os.user.id\`` does not resolve at seed time (boot logs
 * "Unknown variable: os" for exactly these fields), which is why this flow
 * exists in the first place. So ownership at the platform level is THIS flow's
 * job, and nothing else's.
 *
 * Hence: every pass stamps BOTH columns, and each object is swept twice — once
 * for rows missing `owner`, once for rows missing `owner_id`. Two single-field
 * filters rather than one `$or`: `{ field: null }` is the only filter shape
 * these sweeps have ever used against the real driver, and a half-claimed row
 * (the state above) must still be reachable, which a single `owner`-keyed pass
 * cannot do. On a healthy org both passes select nothing.
