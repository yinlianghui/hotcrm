/**
 * Customer Churn Signals — a "joined" report that gives a Customer Success
 * Manager a one-screen view of the three populations that matter for
 * proactive churn intervention:
 *
 *   1. At-Risk Accounts     — active accounts with no activity in 60+ days
 *   2. Silent High-Value    — strategic/enterprise accounts gone quiet (90+ days)
 *   3. Recently Closed-Lost — opportunities lost in the last 30 days
 *
 * Each block is an independent sub-report; the joined renderer stacks them
 * vertically. There is no container-level filter on this report — each block
 * carries its own scope because they query different objects (`crm_account`,
 * `crm_opportunity`) at different time horizons.
 *
 * Time windows use the spec's date-macro placeholders (`{60_days_ago}`, …,
 * DATE_MACRO_TOKENS in @objectstack/spec/data), which resolve per-query.
 * Computing the dates at module load froze them into dist/objectstack.json,
 * so every window silently stopped rolling on the day the artifact was built.
 *
 * Joined Reports demonstrate the spec's M3 capability: multi-block analytic
 * surfaces with shared chrome but independent data binding.
