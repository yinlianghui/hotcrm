  // sharing rule or team grant extends). The objects below carry an explicit
  // `readScope: 'own'` so the intent is authored, not inferred — this both
  // silences the `security-private-no-readscope` liveness warning and pins the
  // behavior: without it, a private-OWD object with allowRead but no scope is
  // an under-specified grant the engine reads as "own only" anyway.
  //
  // What widens that scope today is narrower than it sounds: the territory /
  // account-team rules are authored on `crm_account` ONLY, and a sharing rule
  // widens the object it names — not the records hanging off it. So a rep who
  // receives an account through a territory rule reads the account and its
  // contacts (`controlled_by_parent`), while the quotes, contracts and tasks on
  // it stay own-only, and opportunities widen only through the >= $100k
  // leadership rules. Whether those children should follow the account is an
  // open business decision (#549), not a bug in these grants — do not widen
  // them here to paper over it.
