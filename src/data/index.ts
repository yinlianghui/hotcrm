/**
 * CRM Seed Data — the aggregating export.
 *
 * Demo records for all core CRM objects, authored per object family in the
 * `*.seed.ts` modules below and collected here as the single `CrmSeedData`
 * array `objectstack.config.ts` registers. Uses `defineSeed()` for type-safe
 * field name checking at compile time.
 *
 * The families were one 100KB module until #635: it sat ~1.5KB under the
 * `pnpm hygiene` byte cap, so the next demo record — the billing addresses of
 * #638 — would have failed the build, and the cheapest way out would have been
 * deleting the explanatory comments the cap exists to protect. Where to add a
 * record now follows from the object:
 *
 *   - `_shared.ts`      seed doctrine + helpers used by more than one family
 *   - `catalog.seed.ts` products, and the catalogue price lookup
 *   - `sales.seed.ts`   accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, opp lines
 *   - `service.seed.ts` tasks, cases, knowledge articles
 *   - `marketing.seed.ts` campaigns, campaign members
 *   - `revenue.seed.ts` contracts, quotes, quote lines, forecasts
 *   - `field-service.seed.ts` assets, work orders

/**
 * Ownership and CRM positions are NOT seeded here — they can't be.
 *
 * A seed can't name a user. Lookup values are resolved against the target's
 * externalId and that only works for objects in the app's own graph, so
 * `owner: 'Dev Admin'` stores the literal string rather than an id (verified:
 * a `sys_user_position` row seeded that way is unmatchable by the real user
 * id), and `cel\`os.user.id\`` inside a seed evaluates to nothing. The id does
 * not exist until first boot.
 *
 * The `demo_bootstrap` scheduled flow (`src/flows/demo-bootstrap.flow.ts`)
 * does it at the only moment it can: once the first real user exists, its
 * periodic sweep claims every ownerless seeded record for that user.
 *
 * That sweep owns BOTH ownership columns, and it has to (#622). Seed writes
 * run under `{ isSystem: true }`, which by the seeder's documented contract
 * disables the security plugin's auto-injection of `organization_id` /
 * `owner_id` — "seeds either declare those fields explicitly per record" — and
 * per the paragraph above these seeds cannot declare it. So a seeded row can
 * reach the database owned by nobody at the PLATFORM level (`owner_id` null)
 * even though the app's own `owner` lookup later reads as claimed, and under
 * `sharingModel: 'private'` such a row is editable by no one at all, admin
 * included. Nothing here should grow an `owner` / `owner_id` seed value to
 * paper over that: the sweep is the mechanism, and
 * `test/flow-scheduled.test.ts` holds it to claiming both columns.
