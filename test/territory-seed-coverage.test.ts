/**
 * The territory rules must match REAL seeded accounts (#638).
 *
 * ### The defect this file exists to catch
 *
 * #621 fixed the installation half: both territory rules now compile and seed
 * (`test/sharing-seeding.test.ts` pins that). The data half was still empty —
 * not one seeded account carried a `billing_address`, so both rules evaluated
 * correctly against nine rows and matched **zero**. Nothing failed: Setup
 * listed two territories, two positions, and nothing behind them.
 *
 * A "declared rule is seeded" assertion cannot see that, and neither can a
 * "seed has an address" assertion on its own — the two only mean something
 * joined. So this file walks the entire chain the demo depends on, using the
 * platform's own pieces at every step rather than a re-implementation:
 *
 *   seed record  →  `account_protection` (the real hook body)
 *                →  `billing_country`
 *                →  `compileCelToFilter(rule.condition)` (the seeder's own
 *                   compiler, the same call `plugin-sharing` makes)
 *                →  which accounts each territory actually covers.
 *
 * ### Hooks DO run over seed writes — measured, not assumed
 *
 * The chain above is only valid because lifecycle hooks fire on seed inserts,
 * which is what makes `billing_country` exist at all on a seeded row (the seeds
 * deliberately do not author it — it is `readonly` and hook-owned). #617
 * doubted this; measured on 17.0.0-rc.1 against a fresh install, all nine
 * seeded accounts come out of `pnpm dev` carrying the projection:
 *
 *     sqlite> SELECT name, billing_country FROM crm_account;
 *     Acme Corporation|US     Stark Medical|CA      Northwind Energy|DE
 *     Apex Logistics|SG       Lattice Education|UK  …
 *
 * `SeedLoaderService.SEED_OPTIONS` says the same thing in words: its
 * `skipTriggers` suppresses record-change AUTOMATION (autolaunched flows) for
 * seed writes, while "Lifecycle HOOKS (derived/default fields, validation)
 * still run". `src/data/_shared.ts` now states the corrected premise.
 *
 * ### What is NOT covered here
 *
 * A matching account still materialises no `sys_record_share` row, because on a
 * fresh install `sys_user_position` is empty — nobody holds `na_sales_team` or
 * `eu_sales_team` (measured: 0 rows, 0 shares). That is a separate gap, filed
 * separately; it is not something the seed data can fix, since a seed cannot
 * name a user (see the note at the foot of `src/data/index.ts`).
