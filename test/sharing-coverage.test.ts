/**
 * Record-level sharing coverage guards (#549).
 *
 * A sharing rule widens **the object it names** — never the records hanging off
 * it. HotCRM authors its widening rules on `crm_account` (territory + team),
 * but the account's children each keep their own baseline: `crm_contact` is
 * `controlled_by_parent` and follows, while `crm_quote`, `crm_contract` and
 * `crm_task` are `private` with no rule of their own, and `crm_opportunity`
 * only widens through the >= $100k leadership rules. A rep who receives an
 * account through a territory rule therefore opens it to partially empty
 * related lists.
 *
 * Whether those children *should* follow the account is an open business
 * decision (#549) — widening any of them changes what every holder of that
 * object sees, not just the territory recipient. These tests do not take that
 * decision. They pin two things so it stays a decision instead of drift:
 *
 *   1. the coverage ledger below — the shipped answer, per account child, so a
 *      new child object (or a rule added/removed) has to update it knowingly;
 *   2. the admin docs — the prose that describes who sees what has to keep
 *      matching the metadata. The gap in #549 was reported as a *promise*
 *      problem: `content/docs/revenue/contracts.mdx` told admins "contracts
 *      follow the account's sharing" while the metadata delivered own-only.
 *
 * `test/authorization-coverage.test.ts` (#488/#547) covers the object-grant
 * half — this file is only about record-level reach.
